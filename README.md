# 🤖 Smart Agent Project

This is a beginner-friendly Agentic AI project built using [Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/agent-development-kit/overview). It demonstrates how to create a smart agent that can answer questions about the **weather** and **current time** by calling Python functions (tools) intelligently.

## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI enables language models to act more like agents: making decisions, calling tools (functions/APIs), and solving complex tasks beyond just generating text.

This project includes:
- 🛠️ Tool-based reasoning (`get_weather`, `get_time`)
- 🌐 Gemini 2.0 Pro LLM via Google's Generative AI API
- 🔄 Real-time interaction via the terminal
